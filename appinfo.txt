postgres on docker does not work well with large scale projects. however, I think this is

docker exec wolverine_overflow-web-1 bash -c "python3 app.py"


things i downloaded (even those i am not using(not inclusive, probably forgot some stuff)):

postgresql
docker
psycopg2 python library

import docker

client = docker.DockerClient()
container = client.containers.get(container_id_or_name)
ip_add = container.attrs['NetworkSettings']['IPAddress']
print(ip_add)
